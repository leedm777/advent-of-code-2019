My solutions for the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

## Usage

    $ lein run dayXX # for day00 through day25

## Things I learned

 - `day00`
   - You have to require a namespace before `find-ns` can find it
   - You can return `(reduced X)` to short circuit a `(reduce)` to return
     `X`.
 - `day01`
   - You need to be really quick to score points
   - `quot` returns just the quotient of a division; simpler than converting
     to `int`
 - `day02`
   - `(assoc vector location value)` is the proper way to update a vector
   - The `->>` and `->` macros are a pain if you need to mix first/last args
   - Use `as->` to mix and match better
   - `case` is more like switch-case than `cond`
 - `day03`
   - Lots of off by one errors trying to figure out this solution
   - Cider (or maybe the REPL in general) requires-in a lot of things that aren't
     required in by defaults, so tests and stuff may pass in the REPL, but will fail
     during `lein run` or `lein test`
   - There's a million different ways to lookup key `k` in map `m`
     - `(m k)`
     - `(get m k)`
     - `(:k m) ;; if k is a keyword`
   - My solution would have been much simpler if I had focused on tracking just the path
     instead of overall state (points, position, etc)
   - Cider keystrokes
     - `C-c M-n (M-)n` - switch to current namespace
     - `C-c C-z` - switch to repl buffer
 - `day04`
   - Even simple things can be hard if you think about them too much.
   - Wasn't obvious from the docs, but `(update)` can update vectors :-)
   - `(partition-by)` is super cool. "Applies f to each value in coll,
     splitting it each time f returns a new value."
   - `(re-find)` returns first match; `(re-matches)` has to match the whole string.
 - `day05`
   - `zero?` exists
   - `if-not` exists
   - Really should've had a single map with machine state that each method
     operated on. See https://github.com/sooheon/aoc/blob/6e490e55f5cc9797f43060b89a94e9756e5be9be/aoc-clojure/src/main/aoc/2019/day05.clj
     - Which I couldn't resist and actually ended up doing...
